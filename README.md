  Write newsletters in <strong>Markdown</strong> and send to many recipients from your machine using <strong>AWS SES</strong>.
</p>

## Features

‚úçÔ∏è **Markdown** for writing the content

üåà **Styling** using CSS (automatically *inlined*)

üì® **Send** using AWS SES respecting rate limits

## Prerequisites

Prepare your AWS SES account and configure access to AWS on your machine:

 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sign-up-for-aws.html
 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html

## Getting Started

```sh
npm i newsletter-cli -g
```

- Step 1: Run `newsletter prepare` to get started. Follow the command's instructions.
- Step 2: Run `newsletter edit <newsletter-name>` to open the prepared markdown file for the newsletter using an editor. Write your newsletter!
- Step 3: Run `newsletter preview <newsletter-name>` to preview the resulting HTML of your newsletter in a web-browser.
- Step 4: Run `newsletter send <newsletter-name> <recipients-csv> <from-email>` to send the newsletter in bulks respecting the send rate of AWS SES.

## Parameters

- `<newsletter-name>` is the internal name for your newsletter (alphanumerical characters and `-`, `_` only). 
    The newsletter name defines the name of the local file where the newsletter source is stored. 
    <newsletter-name> is stored as <newsletter-name>.md
- `<recipients-csv>` is the path to a file containing recipients of the newsletter. 
    The file must be comma-separated (,) and must contain column headers in the first row. 
    The column named 'email' must be present in the file
- `<from-email>` is the email address which will appear as the sender of the newsletter.

## Using variables in the template

You can use variables in the templates as supported by [AWS SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html). The variables can be used in the subject and inside the body:

```
---
subject: Hi {{name}}! Subject of your awesome newsletter!
---

Hi {{name}}!

Here goes the text of your awesome newsletter!
```

In the snippet above, the `name` column is required for all recipients in the CSV file.

Unfortunately, if the template rendering fails, AWS SES does not return an error. To detect rendering errors, you will need to subscribe to build an async recovery mechanism as described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-api.html).

The reasons why template rendering can fail:

- missing variables
- typos in variable names
- invalid template expressions

The CLI tries to validate as much as possible but it's still recommended to set up a recovery mechanism for the rendering failures.

## User configuration file

An optional user configuration file can be placed at `${HOME}/.newsletter-cli/config.js`, which allows certain customizations. The [sample user configuration](user-config.sample.js) is commented with the possible customizations.
